# Cyber Security Reading Group

Welcome to the repository for our reading group focused on exploring recent research papers and developments in AI Safety, Secutiry, and Privacy.

# Repository Structure

Each reading group session has its own dedicated folder. The structure is as follows:

```text
│
├── 2025-03-26_Backdoor_Attacks_in_LLM_Agents
│   ├── slides.pdf
│   └── papers/
│       ├── BadAgent.pdf
│       ├── AgentPoison.pdf
│       └── BadChain.pdf
│
└── 2025-04-02_Defense_Strategies_for_Backdoors
    ├── slides.pdf
    └── papers/
        ├── DefensePaper1.pdf
        └── DefensePaper2.pdf
```

- **Folder Naming Convention**: Use the format `YYYY-MM-DD_Topic_of_the_Session` for each session folder.
- **Slides**: Slides from the presentation should be saved as `slides.pdf`.
- **Papers**: All discussed papers should be placed inside a dedicated `papers` subdirectory.

## Contribution Guidelines

Everyone is encouraged to actively participate by:
